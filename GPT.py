# Selenium is a tool for automating web browsers. It allows you to control a web browser as if you were a user, and interact with web pages programmatically.
#
# Selenium Webdriver is the most popular tool for automating web browsers. It provides a way to interact with web browsers using a programming language, such as Python.
#
# To use Selenium Webdriver with Python, you will first need to install the selenium package using pip:
#
# Copy code
# pip install selenium
# The first step in using Selenium Webdriver is to start a new browser session. You can do this by creating a new instance of a webdriver class, such as webdriver.Chrome() for chrome browser or webdriver.Firefox() for Firefox browser. This will launch a new browser window.
#
# Once you have a browser session started, you can navigate to a website using the get() method. For example, driver.get("http://www.google.com") will navigate to the Google homepage.
#
# To find elements on a web page, you can use the find_element_by_* methods, where * can be replaced with various locators such as id, name, class name, CSS selector, Xpath and so on. For example, driver.find_element_by_id("element_id") will find an element with the ID "element_id".
#
# Once you have found an element, you can interact with it using various methods. For example, you can click an element using elem.click(), send text to an element using elem.send_keys("text to send"), and clear the text in an element using elem.clear().
#
# To navigate between pages, you can use the back() and forward() methods on the driver object.
#
# To close the browser, you can use the quit() method on the driver object.
#
# Selenium also provides find_elements_by_* methods to find multiple elements matching the given locator, you can use them to perform an action on multiple elements at the same time.
#
# Also, you can use explicit wait or implicit wait before performing any action on an element to wait for an element to be present in the DOM.
#
# Keep in mind that Selenium automates a browser, so whatever actions you perform through the Selenium script, it will be visible to the end user.
#
